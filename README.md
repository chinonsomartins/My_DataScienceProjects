# My Data Science Projects

Welcome to my **Data Science practice repository** ðŸŽ¯  

This repo contains different projects and experiments Iâ€™m working on as I explore and grow in the field of Data Science. Most of the projects here are **practice-based**, focusing on building a strong foundation and applying concepts to real datasets.  

## Purpose
- To document my journey into **Data Science**  
- To practice core concepts such as data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and modeling  
- To gradually build confidence in solving real-world problems using Python and ML tools  

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
Some of the projects youâ€™ll find here include:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks  
- Machine learning practice projects (classification, regression, etc.)  
- Time series and forecasting experiments  
- Hands-on mini projects with real datasets  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

##  Looking Ahead
This repo will continue to grow as I learn new concepts and take on more challenging projects.
